# CRMFetchXmlWrapper
The nice thing about having the Fetch Xml in the code is it's easy to read and you can quickly tell what the query is supposed to do. Unfortunately, there's no help from intellisense.

This solution provides classes to construct your fetch xml simply and serialize / deserialize fetchxml strings.
