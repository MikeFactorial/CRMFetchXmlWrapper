# CRMFetchXmlWrapper
The nice thing about having the Fetch Xml in your code is it's fairly easy to read and you can quickly tell what the query is supposed to do. Unfortunately, there's no help from intellisense.

This solution provides classes to construct your fetch xml simply using .NET classes and serialize / deserialize fetchxml strings.
